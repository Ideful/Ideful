Hi there!

My name is Konstantin, I am a student of Moscow 21 School. 

Today, on 29.04 I've finished "C" language branch in 21-st.
Now I am going to start learning OOP with C++. 

In June I will successfully finish SQL Bootcamp in the school and I am glad to share I've already finished my first OOP project, OOP_Matrix.

Also I'll be happy to discuss any other things in telegram
